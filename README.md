Send coordinates from eye tracker to chrome extension. Currently uses lightly filtered gaze data settings (as opposed to unfiltered gaze or fixation data).
Depends on [websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp) (which depends on Boost) and the [Tobii SDK](http://developer.tobii.com/eyex-sdk/c-cplusplus/)
Boost does need to be built and the libraries included (will add details later)
